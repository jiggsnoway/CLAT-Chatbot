🎯 Project Title
Rule-Based Chatbot for CLAT Legal Exam Queries

📌 Objective
To develop a basic chatbot that can respond to frequently asked questions about the CLAT exam using a simple rule-based approach.

🧠 Approach / Architecture
1. Implemented the chatbot using Python in Google Colab.

2. The bot takes user input through the terminal and responds based on keyword matches.

3. Used if-elif conditions to match user queries with predefined answers.

4. Handled flexible phrasing by checking for multiple keywords (e.g., "cutoff" or "cut-off", "nlsiu" or "bangalore").

5. Covers common queries related to syllabus, sections, cut-offs, number of questions, and duration.

💬 Sample Questions Answered
1. “What is the syllabus for CLAT 2025?”

2. “How many questions are in the English section?”

3. “What is the cut-off for NLSIU Bangalore?”

4. “What is the duration of the exam?”

💡 Bonus: Scaling to GPT
 To expand this project:

1. A GPT-based model could be fine-tuned on NLTI’s internal CLAT-related content (FAQs, guides, blogs).

2. Using retrieval-based NLP (e.g., with LangChain or RAG pipelines), the chatbot could fetch answers from a custom legal knowledge base.

3. This would allow for more natural, open-ended conversation and deeper query understanding.

🧪 Tech Stack
1. Python

2. Google Colab

🚀 How to Run
1. Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

2. Run the code cell to start the chatbot.

3. Type your CLAT-related questions into the prompt.

4. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.
